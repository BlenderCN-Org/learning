- Precusor is asm.js and Google's Native Client (NaCl).
- Designed to complement and work alongside javascript.
- Allows programs to be written in languages like C, and be compiled into webpages (using Emscripten) where functions from the original C program can be called in javascript, via javascript's WebAssembly Object/API function called ccall().

How to log SSL/TLS master secrets to file:
	- Create global variable in Windows PATH, and point it to the location of a text file on hard drive.
	- The Client_Random entry is for Diffie-Hellman negotiated sessions and the RSA entry is for sessions using RSA or DSA key exchange.  If you have the captured TLS encrypted network traffic, these provide the missing pieces needed for decryption.
