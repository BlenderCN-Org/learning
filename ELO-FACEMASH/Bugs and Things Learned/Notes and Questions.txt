Unsorted:

ES5 introduced the bind() method to set the value of a function's this regardless of how it's called, and ES2015 introduced arrow functions which don't provide their own this binding (it retains the this value of the enclosing lexical context). (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)

// Bugs:
// Quotation marks are automatically being put in the value of the value field on HTML buttons.
// Serialize/unserialize messes up because of that, and so does json_encode/decode.  ALL THESE SCRIPTING LANGUAGES SUCK BECAUSE THEY DON'T EVEM MAKE ANYTHING EASIER ON THE FUCKING DEVELOPER IN THE LONG RUN.  It's like someone said "HEY, LETS MAKE ALL THESE SCRIPTING LANGUAGES SO HARD TO DEVELOP IN, PEOPLE WILL SPEND ALL DAY LEARNING IT INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY MAKING SHIT IN IT!  DERP!"

// Have to find alternative way, because this is bullshit
// Any alternative way will be the same as the old way -- Sending both values and then parsing it out later, since both players need to be sent through to calculate winner/loser scores.  No idea.  No solution found after 2 nights.
// https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14071587/php-pass-array-through-post - I guess hidden fields are the only way.  Use hidden field to contain both players and then sort upon POST request.  This is retarded, since hidden fields can be altered.
