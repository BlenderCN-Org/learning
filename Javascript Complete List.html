[Introduction from Wikipedia] 
"JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it and it is supported by all modern Web browsers without plug-ins. JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

[JS Related Concepts]
Although there are strong outward similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two are distinct languages and differ greatly in their design. JavaScript was influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme."

Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming in which behaviour reuse (known as inheritance) is performed via a process of reusing existing objects via delegation that serve as prototypes.[4]

In computer science, a programming language is said to have first-class functions if it treats functions as first-class citizens. Specifically, this means the language supports passing functions as arguments to other functions, returning them as the values from other functions, and assigning them to variables or storing them in data structures.[1]

In computer science, a literal is a notation for representing a fixed value in source code. [9]

[Modules & Patterns]
https://intrepidis.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/javascript-folding-pattern.html
http://metaduck.com/08-module-pattern-inheritance.html

"Though JavaScript provides no actual module construct yet, objects can be used to create publicly accessible subnamespaces, and functions can be used to create an isolated, private namespace inside of a module." [26]

[Declarations]
	Global variables [25]:
	- Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.
	- Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.	
	
	Three Ways of Declaring variables [25]:
	- With the keyword var. This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
	- Assigning Values. For example, x = 42. This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
	- With the keyword let. This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable.
	
	var a = 0, b = 0;
	var a = 0;

	const MY_FAV = 7;
	const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"};

	Let Statement:
	let x = 1;
	
	Let Block: 
	var x = 5;
	var y = 0;
	let (x = x+10, y = 12) {
		console.log(x+y); // 27
	}
	console.log(x + y); // 5
	
	Let Expression:
	var a = 5;
	let(a = 6) console.log(a); // 6
	console.log(a); // 5
	
	Declaration Notes:
	- Let expression lets you establish variables scoped only to a single expression.  When used inside a block (such as an if-statement), scope is limited to that block/statement. [22]
	- May encounter errors in switch statements because there is only one underlying block.

[Functions]
Function Expression: var abc = function() { ... }
Function Declaration/Statement: function abc() { ... }
Function Constructor: new Function ([arg1[, arg2[, ...argN]],] functionBody)
Anonymous Function: function(a, b){return a+b;}
Anonymous Function Assigned to Variable (Function Literal): var abc = function(a, b){return a+b;} [7]
Self Invoking/Executing Anonymous Function Expression (Added parenthesis makes it an expression): (function() { alert('Hello World'); })();

	Get Syntax: Binds an object property to a function that will be called when that property is looked up. [13] [16]
		- As property of object. [13]
		- Using Object.defineProperty(), to append a getter to an existing object later at any time, . [13]
		- __defineGetter__() - (DEPRECATED) [15]

	Set Syntax: binds an object property to a function to be called when there is an attempt to set that property. [14]	
	
		Native Function Properties:
		- .arguments [19], .caller, .length, .name, .displayName, .prototype
	Native Function Methods:
		- .apply [12], .bind, .call [11], .toSource, .toString, .isGenerator

	Arrow Functions [17]: 
		- Are shorter, and always anonymous.
		- Best suited for non-method functions and they can not be used as constructors (new keyword).
		- "this" is lexical (strict mode rules with regard to this are ignored).
		- Two Types of Syntax:
			- var func = x => x * x;                  // concise syntax, implied "return"
			- var func = (x, y) => { return x + y; }; // with block body, explicit "return" needed
	
	Handler Functions and Closures:
		- https://www.sitepoint.com/function-expressions-vs-declarations/
	
	Generator Functions (Functions with an asterix *): [21]
		- Generators are functions which can be exited and later re-entered. Their context (variable bindings) will be saved across re-entrances. Calling a generator function does not execute its body immediately; an iterator object for the function is returned instead. When the iterator's next() method is called, the generator function's body is executed until the first yield expression, which specifies the value to be returned from the iterator or, with yield*, delegates to another generator function. The next() method returns an object with a value property containing the yielded value and a done property which indicates whether the generator has yielded its last value as a boolean. Calling the next() method with an argument will resume the generator function execution, replacing the yield statement where execution was paused with the argument from next().
		- The yield() keyword pauses and resumes generator functions.
		- The yield* expression delegates to another generator or iterable object.
	
	Function Parameters:
		- A JavaScript function does not perform any checking on parameter values (arguments), number of parameters, or type of parameters. [27]
		- If a function is called with missing arguments (less than declared), the missing values are set to: undefined. [27]
		- If a function is called with too many arguments (more than declared), these arguments can be reached using the arguments object. [27]
		- JavaScript arguments are passed by value.  Changes to arguments are not visible (reflected) outside the function. [27]
		- In JavaScript, object references are values. Because of this, objects will behave like they are passed by reference. If a function changes an object property, it changes the original value. [27]
		
	Rest Parameters:
		- Allow indefinite number of arguments to a function. [18]
		
	Function Notes:
		- In JavaScript every function is actually a Function object. [5]
		- Functions can be used as values.
		- Functions have properties and methods, just like objects.
		- Function Constructor (new keyword) is least efficient method of using/creating functions. [5]
		- Functions created with the New keyword do not form a closure. [6]
		- Function declarations are more desireable because they're declared at compile time and can be used anytime in the scope due to hoisting.  Function expressions are not. [8]
		- Global function methods can be created/added using Function.prototype. (Example: Function.prototype.construct = function(args){};) [12]
		- Functions are the only thing in JavaScript that create a new scope. [26]
		- A function defined as the property of an object is called a method. [28]
		- A function designed to create new objects is called a constructor. [28]
		

[Global Properties]
Infinity
	- Infinity is a numeric value that represents positive infinity.
	- -Infinity is a numeric value that represents negative infinity.
	- Infinity is displayed when a number exceeds the upper limit of the floating point numbers, which is 1.797693134862315E+308.
	- -Infinity is displayed when a number exceeds the lower limit of the floating point numbers, which is -1.797693134862316E+308
		
[Global Functions]
	Eval() [23]
	- If the argument is an expression, eval() evaluates the expression. If the argument is one or more JavaScript statements, eval() executes the statements.	
		
	Number() [24]
	- The Number() function converts the object argument to a number that represents the object's value.
	- If the value cannot be converted to a legal number, NaN is returned.
	- If the parameter is a Date object, the Number() function returns the number of milliseconds since midnight January 1, 1970 UTC.
	
[Gotchas]
	- JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations or expressions.

	- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7064673/is-return-from-constructor-necessary-when-creating-object-with-new
	- The semi-colon is part of the statement syntax. It belongs to the statement itself, and sequences of statements do not need any sort of separator. In order to "chain" statements, one simply writes them in sequence, with no seperator in between. [29]
	- An initial parenthesis is one case where the automatic semicolon insertion (ASI) in JavaScript can cause problems; the expression is instead interpreted as a call to the last term on the preceding line. In some styles that omit optional semicolons, the semicolon is placed in front of the parenthesis, and is known as a defensive semicolon. [30]
	- Parenthesis cannot contain statements, so anything between them is treated as an expression. [30]

[Questions]
"Invoking the Function constructor as a function (without using the new operator) has the same effect as invoking it as a constructor." [5]

Why no return statement when using new keyword?  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5958417/javascript-function-and-object
