While watching the movie The Social Network (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1), about Mark Zuckerberg when he founded Facebook while at Harvard, I saw the part where they come up with the initial idea for Facemash, a website which would later be used to rate pictures of girls at Harvard (similar to Hot or Not, a more popular version).  During one of the scenes, Mark consults with his friend about the algorithm, which is written on a blackboard.  Since the movie glorifies the algorithm, I wanted to explore it further and actually apply it to some kind of app, and what better than similar to the original Facemash, which used the original algorithm?  At the time of this writing, there isn't any sites I could find that makes use of it, but only pages that discuss it.

Here is a still image from the movie of them writing down the algorithm: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fc/ff/a0/fcffa093c3ba1dd02ebda0e5a83388c1.png

ELO.php is a standalone, browser-based, file (although it may run on CLI) which shows and explains the algorithm in detail.  It would be redundant to do that here.

Obvious Note:  I did NOT write/invent the ELO rating formula/algorithm.  I am just studying and applying it since it's been used in software numerous times.  I'm sure I don't really need to say this, however.  Also, don't criticize my use of antiquated HTML techniques such as <font color="">.  I am merely using it out of ease.

What was learned from this experiment: See ELO.php (or it's output, if I provide an image of it).
