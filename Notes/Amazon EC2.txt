Best option for me: Create an AMI, which contains all OS and software currently running on the instance. See: https://www.cloudberrylab.com/resources/blog/how-to-move-amazon-ec2-to-different-availability-zone-vpc-region/

Also, you could make an ISO file of the instance from the instance itself and then download it.
