Best option for me: Create an AMI, which contains all OS and software currently running on the instance. See: https://www.cloudberrylab.com/resources/blog/how-to-move-amazon-ec2-to-different-availability-zone-vpc-region/

Also, you could make an ISO file of the instance from the instance itself and then download it.

Launch Templates (*NOT Launch Configurations*) may be a better solution to both, but they require an AMI to be made first (even if you select "Create Template From Instance" after right-clicking a specific instance). See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-asg-launch-template.html

I set up load balancer, and autoscaling, and instances launched (https://snag.gy/EcYkBK.jpg), but don't know how domain name is able to point to IP addresses it doesn't know yet.

These guys have the same problem:

Apparently I need to use the DNS name of the load balancer, but I used Target Groups, which don't seem to have one.  I think Route 53 will handle them all, but I'd like to not have to use them because there are additional charges then, and I already have nameservers.
