"Framework" versus "Library", from Wikipedia article "Javascript framework" -- "It differs from a JavaScript library in its control flow:[1] a library offers functions to be called by its parent code, whereas a framework defines the entire application design.[2] A developer does not call a framework; instead it is the framework that will call and use the code in some particular way." Source: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_framework.

"Virtual DOM" versus "Shadow DOM": See above.
