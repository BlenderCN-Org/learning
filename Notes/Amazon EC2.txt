Best option for me: Create an AMI, which contains all OS and software currently running on the instance. See: https://www.cloudberrylab.com/resources/blog/how-to-move-amazon-ec2-to-different-availability-zone-vpc-region/

Also, you could make an ISO file of the instance from the instance itself and then download it.

Lauch templates may be a better solution to both, but they require an AMI to be made first (even if you select "Create Template From Instance" after right-clicking a specific instance). See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-asg-launch-template.html
